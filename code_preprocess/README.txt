1. pre_train_factvideo1: 
   1) code: 
      generate_list_for_allframes.m: it is to generate the training and testing video frame list
      dat2mat_coco_pre.m: it is to transfer the .dat file to .mat file
      mat2txt.m : it is to transfer the .mat file to .txt type

   2) feature_resnet_coco_pre: it is an examples for visual features, and both the training and testing are included.
                               e.g. train: 
                                          train.txt: it is the frame list for training, which is generated by generate_list_for_allframes.m
                                          train_val_resnet_places205.prototxt: it is the model for visual feature
                                          lrcn_resnet_iter_490000.caffemodel: it is the pre-trained model on MSCOCO （it is omitted considering the storage space, you can train the model with LRCN on MSCOCO）
                                          train_pool5_coco_pre.dat (it is also omitted considering the storage space): it is the feature with .dat from .prototxt 
                                          train_pool5_coco_pre_mat.mat (omitted): it is the feature with .mat from .dat
                                          train_pool5_coco_pre_txt.txt (omitted): it is the feature with .txt from .mat
                                          feature_extract.sh: it is a shell file for extracting feature
   3) sent_train_pre_train.txt: it is the reference sentences for pre training
   4) sent_val_pre_train.txt: it is the reference sentences for pre validation                                          
2. pre_train_factvideo2: it is similar to pre_train_factvideo2 but the dataset   
3. EmVidCap: it is similar to pre_train_factvideo1 and pre_train_factvideo2, but the dataset    
4. caffe-master-20160829-mat: you must build this file for visual feature extraction
