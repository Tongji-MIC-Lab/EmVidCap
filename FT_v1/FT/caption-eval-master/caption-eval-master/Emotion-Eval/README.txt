modify the path in the main.py

1. you need build emotion list files (e.g. sentiment-words-E)

2. you need provide the generation sentence file (e.g. val.s2vt_youtube_resnet_iter_160000_beam_size_1.txt)

3. you need provide the reference file (e.g. references.txt)

And then you can run 'python main.py'
